## Summary

This repository presents the design for a covered steel footbridge that is intended to be constructed between the North1 multi-storey carpark and the Faculty of Engineering building. The design includes trusses, a roof, and handrails to ensure the strength, stability, and safety of the footbridge. The primary objective of this project is to provide students with a sheltered passage between these two locations while not obstructing the traffic below.

## Introduction

**Brief Description of the Project:**

A covered steel footbridge is planned to be constructed between the North1 multi-storey carpark and the Faculty of Engineering building at 14 Alliance Lane. The bridge will span 25 meters and will be approximately 3 meters above the ground.

**Assumptions Made:**

- The height of the second floor of the carpark and the North1 building is assumed to be the same, i.e., 3 meters.
- The self-weight of the truss is assumed to be 20kg/m.
- All loads are assumed to be vertical.
- The building site is assumed to be completely flat with no elevations.
- Loads are assumed to be uniformly distributed.
- Weather conditions in the area are assumed to be limited to sun and rain.
